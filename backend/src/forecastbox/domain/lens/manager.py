"""Lens domain -- managing external inspection tool processes (Lens Instances).

Lenses are external processes (e.g. skinnyWMS) that allow interactive inspection
of Run outputs. This module manages their lifecycle: starting, monitoring, and stopping.

Synchronization uses a single lock protecting the LensInstanceManager's instances map.
Pyrsistent immutable structures allow safe lock-free reads.
